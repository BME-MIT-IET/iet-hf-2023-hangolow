# Round

The UI clearly shows how many remaining actions the player has.
The player can indeed carry out the aforementioned amount of actions in the round.
When an action happens, it is indicated clearly, the player loses an action point.

The players can end their rounds prematurely if they click the buton on the right corner, or select the "endTurn" action from the "Actions" menu.
