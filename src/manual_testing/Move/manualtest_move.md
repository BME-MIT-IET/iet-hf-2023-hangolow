# Move manual test results

## Move

It is well displayed which fields the player can currently move to.
Moving to a field is quick and responsive.

Sometimes it is not obvious if the move succeeded or not. (See View test results)

The basic movement seems to work as intended. No problems found.

Moves connected to "special move rules", such as Chorea, Stun, Bear etc., work as well.
One problem we found was that when a player steps onto a field where an other player stands infected with the bear virus, the player does not get infected.
Spreading the infection only works when the bear player moves.
